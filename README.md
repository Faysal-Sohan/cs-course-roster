Three Project Features are give below:
    1. In this project you can add courses to the Cart
    2. Cart is limited to total 20 credits and you can't add same element twice.
    3. A toast will show up when you try to add either same course or more than 20 credit to cart.

State Management in this project:
    To add course to product, to show total credit and price on the cart, I used three state on App component.
    Each state variable is passed as props to Cart component. To load data, I used a state variable on Courses component.
